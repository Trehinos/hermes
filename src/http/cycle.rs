//! High level HTTP types and re-exports.
//!
//! This module groups everything related to parsing or generating HTTP
//! messages.  It is structured into several submodules which are all re-
//! exported at the module root for convenience so that most types can be
//! accessed as `hermes::http::Request`, `hermes::http::Response` and so on.
